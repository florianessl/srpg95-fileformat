# Simulation RPG Maker 95 File Format

This is the result of a few days of playing around with the engine's file formats and teaching myself some reversing skills.
The descriptions mostly correspond to Holbert & Codemason's translation of the program (SilicaAndPina's translation was also used in instances where Holbert's didn't make any sense).

The engine itself is was very underused because of it's complexity compared to RPG95 but also because of it's limitations. It's sad that so few games were made with it outside of Japan, but it proves to an easy exercise for taking one's first steps into reverse engineering.
